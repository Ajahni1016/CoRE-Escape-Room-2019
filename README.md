When the program is started, the screen above is shown. This screen is controlled only through the mouse. Nothing will happen if the players try to use the keyboard. The 4 lock icons represent each of the code words that need to be found. On the successful input of a code, one of the locks will open and the password will be displayed next to it. 

If the unlock button is clicked then the following input screen will open up:

From here the player can type in any word that they believe may be one of the codes and click on the [ENTER] button to test it. Once the [ENTER] button is clicked, the only way to proceed is to press the back button. 

If the code is incorrect, a locked padlock will appear above the input box.
